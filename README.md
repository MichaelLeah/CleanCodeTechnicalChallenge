# Technical Challenge

Technical test completed for a prior position that was focused on demonstrating my ability to create clean, extendable code with PHP. It was also a demonstration of my understanding of Interfaces, Abstract classes and Factories. It could easily have an argument made for some elements to be overkill but for the purpose of demonstration I implemented them all the same.
